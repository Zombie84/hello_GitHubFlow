# hello_GitHubFlow
GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow. The GitHub flow is useful for everyone, not just developers.

## Create a branch
Create a branch in your repository. A short, descriptive branch name enables your collaborators to see ongoing work at a glance. For example, increase-test-timeout or add-code-of-conduct. For more information, see "Creating and deleting branches within your repository."

By creating a branch, you create a space to work without affecting the default branch. Additionally, you give collaborators a chance to review your work.

## Make changes
On your branch, make any desired changes to the repository. For more information, see 
- "Creating new files," 
- "Editing files," 
- "Renaming a file," 
- "Moving a file to a new location," or
- "Deleting files in a repository."
